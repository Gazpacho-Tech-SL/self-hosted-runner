# ARC Self-Hosted Runners

This repository contains configurations for deploying self-hosted runners in Kubernetes environments. 

For more information : https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller
Using github app for authentication: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/authenticating-to-the-github-api

## Custom Runner Image

Two Dockerfiles are provided to build custom runner images:

- **[Helm, Amazon Corretto, Terraform, and AWS CLI](./custom-github-actions-runner)**: This Docker image integrates multiple tools including Helm for Kubernetes package management, Amazon Corretto (a no-cost, multi-platform distribution of OpenJDK), Terraform for managing cloud infrastructure through code, and the AWS CLI for interacting with Amazon Web Services.

## GitHub Actions Workflow: [`deploy-all-runners.yaml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-all-runners.yaml)

This workflow automates the deployment of an Actions Runner Controller to a DevOps EKS Cluster. It triggers on pushes to the `main` branch and can also be manually initiated via the `workflow_dispatch` event.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following GitHub secrets are configured:
- `KUBE_CONFIG_CLUSTER`: This secret should contain the base64-encoded kubeconfig file for the DevOps EKS Cluster.
- `GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN`: This secret should hold your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), used for authenticating with GitHub during scaleset deployments

Here's an updated and more informative version of your README section, now including support for deploying **organization-level runners**, with guidance on using the provided script and recommended GitHub Actions workflow:

## Organization-Level Self-Hosted Runners Deployment

In addition to deploying repository-level runners, this repository also supports deploying **organization-level self-hosted runners** using the Actions Runner Controller (ARC).

> **Organization runners** are available to all repositories within your GitHub organization and can help reduce duplication and simplify runner management.

Deployment Options

You can deploy organization runners using either:

* A **bash script**: [`bash/arc-install-org.sh`](https://github.com/Gazpacho-Tech-SL/self-hosted-runner/blob/main/bash/arc-install-org.sh)
* A **GitHub Actions workflow** (recommended): [`.github/workflows/deploy-org-arc.yaml`](https://github.com/Gazpacho-Tech-SL/self-hosted-runner/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-all-runners.yaml)

Both methods use Helm to deploy the ARC Scaleset with organization-level configuration.


ðŸ“‚ Bash Script Deployment

A bash script is available that you can adapt to deploy organization-level runners manually. This is useful for testing or for CI/CD pipelines outside of GitHub Actions.


âœ… GitHub Actions Workflow Deployment (Recommended)

A preconfigured GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment of an **organization-level runner** scaleset into your Kubernetes cluster.

**Workflow Highlights:**

* Automatically authenticates using a GitHub App (recommended over PAT for org-wide scopes).
* Uses the same Helm chart (`gha-runner-scale-set`) but with organization-scoped values.
* Can be triggered manually or on changes to the runner configuration files.

**Secrets Required in GitHub:**

* `KUBE_CONFIG_CLUSTER`: Base64-encoded kubeconfig for your cluster.
* `GITHUB_APP_ID`: GitHub App ID for ARC authentication.
* `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`: Installation ID for the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key associated with your GitHub App.


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Ensure the file `./org-runner/values.yaml` exists and is properly configured for your organization runner.


## Workflow Steps:
> [!NOTE]
> This step is for deploying scalests without github app and selecting specific repos 
---

1. **Checkout Code**: Retrieves your repository's contents to make them available for the workflow.

2. **Configure Kubeconfig**: Sets up the kubeconfig file used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. The kubeconfig is derived from a base64-encoded secret stored in your GitHub repository.

3. **Deploy ARC Helm Chart**: Installs the Actions Runner Controller Helm chart in the `kube-system` namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. The chart can be found at `oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set-controller`, and the configuration values are defined in [`./arc-controller/arc-controller-values.yaml`](./arc-controller/arc-controller-values.yaml).

4. **Deploy All ScaleSet Helm Charts**: Deploys Helm charts for all scalesets. This step iterates over YAML files located in [`./arc-scalesets/`](./arc-scalesets/), applies environment variables, and deploys each chart to the `runners` namespace. The chart is located at `oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set`.

## Modifying the Workflow:

To adjust the workflow, edit the [`deploy-all-runners.yaml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-all-runners.yaml) file in your repository.

- **Adding Scalesets**: To include a new scaleset, add a YAML configuration file to the [`./arc-scalesets/`](./arc-scalesets/) directory.

- **Removing Scalesets**: To delete a scaleset, uninstall it from the Kubernetes cluster using `helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]`, replacing `[RELEASE_NAME]` with the scalesetâ€™s Helm release name. Remove the corresponding YAML file from the [`./arc-scalesets/`](./arc-scalesets/) directory to prevent future deployments.

- **Changing the Helm Chart**: To use a different Helm chart, update the URLs `oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set-controller` and `oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set` to point to the new chart's location.

- **Changing the Namespace**: To deploy to a different namespace, modify the `--namespace runners` option to your desired namespace. Ensure the namespace exists in your Kubernetes cluster.

Always validate your modifications in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## Utilizing Self-Hosted Runners in GitHub Actions Workflows

After setting up your self-hosted runners, you can specify them in any GitHub Actions workflow using the appropriate `runs-on` labels. These labels should correspond to those configured for your self-hosted runners. For example:

```yaml
jobs:
  run-a-script:
    runs-on: <repo-name-runner>

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Execute a Script
        run: | 
          echo "Hello from a self-hosted runner within the runners namespace!"
```
